Github Repository: https://github.com/ryttings/groupDocumentation

To setup:

1. Install GitHub Desktop (Look here --> https://desktop.github.com/)
1a. Make sure that you use Git Credential Manager!
2. Open Git Bash
3. Navigate to the directory where you want the git repository (User/Documents for example)
4. Run git clone [repo_url] (replace [repo_url] with whatever github repository
5. Run git checkout iteration01
6. Run git pull
7. Run git status to confirm you are up to date on the iteration01 branch!

Other helpful commands:
- git add [file] (tracks a file)
- git commit -m "message" (commits changes to tracked files)
- git push origin [branch_name] (This will push your branch to "origin" which is the default nickname for your remote repository
-->Note: This will only work if your branch and the remote branch do not have any conflicts! If they do, please merge from the remote
branch first to resolve any conflicts
- git merge [commit/branch] merges a branch or specific commit to your current checked out branch (I usually recommend doing this with
a git GUI application for more complicated merges, SmartGit for example)
